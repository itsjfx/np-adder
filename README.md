adds people from a online list to 9kmmrbot

npm i  
edit app.js for your path and twitch channel name  
node app.js

## Usage
- Make sure you edit app.js with your twitch details and your list (mine for Australia is added as default), feel free to change the delay
- You can set predefined channels but the bot can join channels on the fly using !j #USER - note it needs to already be in a channel for you to message it
- When ready to add type !go and it will start adding the list
